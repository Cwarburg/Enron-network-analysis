# Enron-network-analysis
We analyze the Enron email network using centrality measures to identify key individuals, degree similarity to uncover communication patterns, and NLP techniques to extract insights from message content. This reveals structural and semantic dynamics within the organizationâ€™s communication.

Our repo is diveded into two notebooks. The `network.ipynb` contains the network analysis, and the `nlp.ipynb` contains the NLP analysis.
